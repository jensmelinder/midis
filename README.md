# MIDIS data repository

This page provides up to date images of the HUDF in MIRI filters from the MIRI-EC GTO, and the MIDIS-Red observational programmes.
(PIDs: xxxx, and YYYY). In addition, PSF models for the data is available (based on calibration data from Libralato et al. (2024).

The reductions and data quality for the F560W image are described in Östlin et al. (2025). The F770W data has been reduced in the way, 
and will be described in detailed in Östlin et al. (in prep).

If you use the data provided in this repository you should cite Östlin et al., 2025 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...696A..57O/abstract).
